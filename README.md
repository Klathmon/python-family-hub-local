# python-family-hub-local

Just a small python3 library for reading information from Samsung FamilyHub smart-refridgerators locally without accessing the Samung Cloud.


See the `example.py` for how to use it.

Note: I have not found any way of forcing a refresh of the images, and in my experience they tend to be anywhere from 1 hour to 1 day old. This is also using all undocumented APIs that might go away at any time, so don't rely on it too much!
